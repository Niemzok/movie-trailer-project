#Movie website project

The Movie website project is a project for the Udacity Full Stack Web
Development course. It intents to show server side data handling for a web page
using Python. I extended the initial requirements by adding my favorite series
to the site.

##Installation
Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed.
Run entertainment_center.py by running on Mac:
~~~
python entertainment_center.py
